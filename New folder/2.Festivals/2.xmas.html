<center><h1>Christmas-The Birth of Jesus Christ</h1></center>


Christmas (which means “The Mass of Christ”) is a Christian holiday that celebrates the birth of Jesus, who Christians believe is the Son of God.<br> 
Christmas is also a cultural holiday for many non-Christians.<br><br>

Christmas Day is celebrated on the 25th day of December. <br><br>
It is one of the most important days of the year for Christians, along with Easter (which celebrates the death and resurrection of Jesus).<br> <br>
The season of Advent begins on a Sunday about four weeks before Christmas. <br><br>
During Advent, people prepare for Christmas.<br><br>

The Christmas season (called Christmastide) ends 6 January, also called the Twelfth Day of Christmas.<br><br>
 On this day, Christians celebrate 'Epiphany'.<br><br>

People celebrate Christmas in many places around the world.<br><br>
 Some people celebrate Christmas as a religious holiday. <br><br>
In some places, Christmas is a time of celebration for Christians and non-Christians alike. <br><br>
Christmas traditions are different in different countries. <br><br>
However, they almost always include a feast; giving gifts or cards; and enjoying church or public festivities, like singing Christmas carols and songs.<br><br>
Christmas is not limited to Christianity.<br><br>

The idea of Santa Claus is based on Saint Nicholas, a 4th-century Christian saint of Greek origin.<br><br>

In the Northern Hemisphere, Christmastide happens during the winter.<br><br>
 Before Christmas was ever celebrated, ancient peoples celebrated winter festivals. <br><br>
Some traditions from these ancient festivals became Christmas traditions. <br><br>
For example, some Christmas traditions come from the pagan holiday of Yule.<br><br>

Today, Christmas traditions often focus on gift-giving. <br><br>
About a month before Christmas Day, retail stores start selling gifts, food, greeting cards, Christmas trees, and decorations.
