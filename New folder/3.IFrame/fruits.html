<b>Fruits</b>
<p align=justify>In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants that is formed from the ovary after flowering. Fruits are the means by which
 flowering plants(also known as angiosperms) disseminate their seeds. Edible fruits in particular have long propogated using the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic
relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group and nutrition for the other;in fact,humans and many animals have dependent on fruits as a source of food.
 Consequently, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the wolrds agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate)
have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.
