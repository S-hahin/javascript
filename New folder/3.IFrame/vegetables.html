<b>Vegetables</b>
<p align=justify>Vegetables are part of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food. The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants 
collectively to refer to all edible plant matter, including the flowers, fruits, stem, leaves, roots and seeds. An alternate definition of term is applied somewhat arbitrarily,often by culinary and cultural tradition.
 It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts but include savoury fruitrs such as tomotoes and courgettes,flowers such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses.
