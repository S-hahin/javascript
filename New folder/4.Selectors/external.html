CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.<br><br>
We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:<br><br>

->Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class).<br>
->Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them).<br>
->Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state).<br>
->Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element).<br>
->Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value).<br>

</p>

<p class="third">

The CSS id Selector:-<br><br>

The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.<br>
The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!<br>
To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.<br>

</p>

<p id="p">

The CSS class Selector:-<br><br>

The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.<br>
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.<br>

</p>

<p class="p">

The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.<br>
